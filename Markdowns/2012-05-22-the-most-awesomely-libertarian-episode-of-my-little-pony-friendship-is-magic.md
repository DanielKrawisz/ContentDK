## *Introduction*

One of the delightful features of _Friendship is Magic_ is its hard—hitting treatment of real issues. _Over a Barrel_ is about culture clash, war, and the power that trade has to diffuse aggression. Other than the two—part episodes, _Over a Barrel_ is certainly one of the most dramatic episodes of the series, and it comes with a terrific libertarian message too!

## *Treenapped!!!*

The episode begins in a desert traversed by a fast-moving steam engine inexplicably pulled by a team of male ponies in front. Why are they pulling when there is clearly an engine at the front of the train? Perhaps the engine is broken, but if so, this would conflict with the music, which unmistakably invokes the _chuga-chuga_ of a functioning engine. This curious inconsistently is not remarked upon later.

The story _really_ begins in the caboose, where Applejack is reading a bedtime story to an apple tree that is lying in a bed. The story is about growth—a tree fantasy, or what trees might fantasize of if they were sentient. This scene is an interesting precursor to the conflict that dominates the episode because it depicts Applejack showing empathy for something very different from herself—she certainly isn’t going to identify with the story in the way a tree would, but she can understand how it would be the kind of story a tree might enjoy.

Then Rarity enters bearing context. We learn from her conversation with Applejack that the tree is to be a gift to Applejack’s cousins in Appleloosa. Rarity is annoyed that Bloomberg (the tree) gets his own private car whereas she has to sleep in the same car with the other ponies.

“Hm! You talk about it as if it’s your baby or something,” says Rarity.

“Who’re you callin’ a baby? Bloomberg’s no baby! Don’t let widdo Wawity make you all saddy-waddy! Bloomberg’s a big and strong apple tree. Yes he is! A-coochy-coochy coo coo coo!” responds Applejack.

This is funny because Rarity communicates with a very clear implication that Applejack totally misinterprets. The only implications she can hear are those relating to the tree’s well-being.

That night, nothing important happens except the conversation establishing the fandom in—joke identifying Fluttershy with a tree.

The next morning, the ponies awake to a stampede of buffalo outside their window. At first the ponies are amused, “I love their accessories!” exclaims Rarity, drawing attention to their headbands with feathers attached. But then, “They’re getting awfully close to the train!” warns Twilight.

At that moment they attack. They slam against the train and against the ponies pulling it, just to prove they’re attacking. Then two of them form a stack and a third very small buffalo gets on top of both of them and bounds onto the roof of the train. Pinkie Pie is convinced that they’re doing tricks, but Rainbow Dash is skeptical and flies out in pursuit.

The young buffalo, however, manages to evade her by distracting her so that she flies into a train—crossing sign. He then disconnects the caboose from the train. The other buffalo surround it and take it away, kidnapping both Bloomberg and Spike, who had spent the night in the caboose to escape the ponys’ girlish chatter the previous evening.

## *Two Opposing Claims*

Upon reaching Appleloosa without Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash, a pony named Braeburn shows off the town without giving the remaining ponies a chance to explain anything. The economy of Appleloosa, it turns out, is driven by apples and bizarre puns. This is a good place for a digression on Equestrian sociology. One of the interesting things about _Friendship is Magic_ is its inversion of the [Smurfette Principle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602065937/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple). Spike is the token male main character and even the minor characters are mostly female. Equestria is matriarchal society, and this is probably a good thing because none of the male ponies is given a remotely edifying character. They are all fools, like [Snips](https://web.archive.org/web/20160417210801/http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Snips) and [Snails](https://web.archive.org/web/20160417210404/http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Snails), bullies like [Prince Blueblood](https://web.archive.org/web/20160417210118/http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Prince_Blueblood), shysters like the [Flim-Flam brothers](https://web.archive.org/web/20160321113746/http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Flim_Flam_Brothers), or lovable retards like [Big Mac](https://web.archive.org/web/20150924182508/http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Mac).

Appleloosa is the first male—dominated place we have yet seen in _Friendship is Magic_. The second we’ll see very shortly, for when we arrive at the buffalo camp, we don’t even see any females. Could this be an attempt to make a statement about the relationship between gender and war? Could the writers simply _not imagine_ two female—dominated societies in conflict? I don’t know. Anyway, Braeburn explains that the buffalo don’t like the settler ponies’ orchard and have been demanding it be chopped down, but he doesn’t understand why.

Meanwhile, out in the desert, Rainbow has been sneakily tracking the buffalo until she meets Pinkie Pie, whereupon her frustration with Pinkie’s brainlessness makes her forget momentarily to be sneaky. She blows their cover, summoning all the buffalo.

They are about to attack when Spike’s shout stops them. Apparently he has already managed to establish a lot of clout among the buffalo. He leads them back to the buffalo camp.

That evening, Spike explains that the buffalo respect dragons and hence treated him as an honored guest. Case in point, the young buffalo from before approaches to serve Spike with a bowl of delicious turquoise. Spike introduces the young buffalo we met before as Little Strongheart to Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash, who, focused on finding the right moment to leave, barely looks up. The hilarious thing here is that they just put a regular horse snort sound effect to express Rainbow Dash’s disdainful uninterest—they don’t normally make any horse noises at all.

Upon noticing who he is Rainbow double takes and prepares to leave in a huff. However, Little Strongheart is quite conciliatory and takes them to Chief Thunderhooves for an explanation.

The chief speaks in a slow, rough, and grave voice. “We have a long and winding stampeding trail we have run upon for many generations. My father stampeded upon these grounds. And his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him…” As he speaks, the camera pans over some of the other buffalo and we see that they have nearly passed out from sheer boredom over the chief’s discussion. This is a tremendously effective moment both as comedy and as story—telling. It deftly undermines the overdone but rarely—spoofed stereotype of the wise old chief. Chief Thunderhooves is not an awesome font of wisdom, but a boring old pontificator. But more importantly, this scene humanizes the buffalo, showing them to be not mystic outsiders or noble savages, but regular guys who, like everyone, must put up with the annoying traits of one another.

Upon hearing the explanation, Rainbow Dash immediately switches loyalties and correctly identifies the buffalo as the rightful owners of the land. “Come on!” she says, “We have some apple-pickin’ Appleloosans to talk to!”

## *Unenlightening Analysis*

The next morning, Braeburn, Applejack, and the other ponies are preparing for a long trek in the desert to rescue their friends. They trek about 10 feet into the desert… where they find Rainbow and Pinkie standing right in front of them! Immediately a debate begins. Braeburn and Strongheart (who had tagged along) seem willing to listen to one another but Applejack and Rainbow Dash escalate the conflict and are not interested in any discussion. Rainbow says that the buffalo are the rightful owners, whereas Applejack points out that the town’s entire economy depends upon harvesting the land. They yell at each other until Twilight interrupts.

“Look! The ponies and buffalo both have good reasons for using this land. There must be something we can do,” she observes with consternation. I suppose that the writers wanted to depict her as the analytical one for noting two sides to the issue, but I think her analysis simply muddies the waters by ignoring any ethical issues related to property rights. I’m sure everyone can come up with a good reason for using _everything_ regardless of where it is or how they’ve used it before. This line of reasoning would end by concluding that ownership over all resources in the world would have to be distributed according to some kind of overarching considerations Totalitarian implications aside, it a useless observation for the present purposes because it leads no further to any means of conflict resolution: since both sides are in anarchy with regard to one another, any means of conflict resolution would have to be acceptable to both sides, and neither side would be likely agree to a necessarily subjective and arbitrary decision based on who has the more important use for the land. Instead, any agreeable procedure would have to rely on shared ideas about justice, not on Twilight’s technocratic theorizing.

“Hey, I’ve got an idea!” exclaims Pinkie Pie. One fade-out later, she emerges from a giant shell on a stage in a burlesque outfit in front of the ponies and buffalo singing about the similarities of the two groups. I find it to be overtly racist because it argues that because ponies and buffalo are racially similar, they should therefore have a shared group interest which is suppressed by any infighting. Why should it be so important for all ungulates to stick together just because they are ungulates? I suppose if, instead of buffalo, the ponies’ conflict was with lizards or cephalopods or something Pinkie Pie would sing about slaughtering them all indiscriminately.

As was Twilight’s earlier analysis, this is precisely the wrong message. We have already seen that ponies are capable of empathizing with trees, so emphasizing genetic similarity is a red herring, and in fact could be taken to have quite contrary implications. When Pinkie Pie sings, “We all eat hay and oats.\Why be at each others’ throats?” she is really giving more of a reason that the different groups _should_ be fighting, given that they are both in competition for the same resources. Two species that ate completely different things would probably get along more easily.

Also, what is the point of wearing a burlesque outfit if you normally go around nude anyway? And honestly I’m not sure if I’ve seen anyone on this entire show eat either hay _or_ oats.

However, neither side is swayed by this nonsense. “It seems that sheriff Silverstar and I have come to an agreement.” the wise chief intones. “That was the worst performance we’ve ever seen.” Hear, hear, chief.

## *War And Resolution*

War cannot be averted. Next there are scenes of war preparation. The ponies chop down some of the apple trees and use the wood to make barricades. In a hilarious exchange, Twilight tries to sway a pony with a grape bunch cutie mark.

Twilight: If we could just sit down and talk we could—

Grape Bunch Pony: (_as if possessed_) HUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!

Twilight: (_rearing_) Why won’t anybody be rational and reasonable?

The episode is worth watching for just that exchange. I think it’s so _cute_ how they had Twilight use an animal gesture there to express intellectual consternation.

Meanwhile in the buffalo camp, the warriors prepare by donning face paint and headbutting one another. In an amusing exchange with Little Strongheart, Spike laments the next day’s tragedy but does not allow his sadness to interfere with his consumption of a bowl of turquoise that Strongheart just served him. I suppose that, although only a baby dragon, Spike expects to live for centuries and to see everyone else in this episode grow old and die. Taking the long view, he does not attach the same significance to these events as everyone else and remains, as always, somewhat insouciant.

Nearby Rainbow Dash is consulting with the chief. “I know you don’t want to do this!” she says.

“But they have taken our land! what would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?” he asks, like she some brilliant diplomat or something.

“I don’t know. But it’s never too late to think of _something_!”

“At noon, it _will_ be too late!” he replies with foreboding as he dons his warpaint.

[Chief Thunderhooves](b://ef3797a2c1dbca483533e87c73f7bcf1a18612a76bf39da6c2b4e15efbfbad39)

The next day, both sides confront each other from a distance. For a moment, Chief Thunderhooves looks like he is having second thoughts, but when Pinkie Pie tries to sing her song one more time, rage overtakes him and he orders a charge. The buffalo easily break through the ponies barricade, but many are neutralized after being blinded by a barrage of apple pies to the face.

I don’t know what either side was thinking at this point. Obviously, an apple pie is not going to take down a buffalo, and even if apple-based recipes were the only technology available, you’d think that there might be a more effective projectile weapon among them. Meanwhile, the buffalo just fall over when they are hit even though they ought to be able to keep running and take down the entire town. Maybe they all agreed beforehand to a kind of ritualized and less dangerous combat.

If so, this would be quite reminiscent of the medieval Icelandic tradition of the “blood feud”. The way the blood feud used to work is that a person with a grievance against another would threaten to engage their families in an unending cycle of violence. However, nobody really wanted that so the two of them would then go down to the mediator for a ruling that would resolve the conflict. Perhaps the pie war has a similar place in Equestrian tradition.

In any case, conflict is finally resolved when chief Thunderhooves gets hit with a pie. After he tragically falls, some of the pie drips into his mouth. At once his entire mindset changes. He is inspired with an entrepreneurial idea. The ponies do not have to vacate the land—they can rent it in exchange for apples and apple pies.

In the remaining scenes, we see the ponies chopping down a path in the orchard wide enough for the buffalo to stampede through. They then give up a supply of apple pies in rent.

## *Conclusion*

What can I say? I’m stunned. This episodes at once tackles heavy issues race, colonialism, and culture clashes and presents peace, private property, and trade as the solution!

This is possibly the most libertarian children’s television show episode I have ever seen. Typically in kids’ shows, conflict occurs between two characters either within an established order over which they have no control (as the Muppet Babies do under their nanny, who is in reality most likely a kidnapper since we never see their real parents) or where one side is taken to be so evil that defeating him is the only option considered by anybody (_He-Man, Ninja Turtles_, etc.).

Whereas _Over a Barrell_ presents us with conflict between two sides which are both _sovereign_, politically independent, and morally equal. The characters need to come up with a “win-win” resolution by their own initiative. And the solution doesn’t turn out to be some tripe about appreciating different cultures or celebrating our differences or nonsense like that, but the purely practical, _economic_ fact that people with different skills, possessions, and tastes can make each other better off by cooperating.

This episode also illustrates the principle that the focus of production within a market tends to shift to the benefits of those most in need. Although rightful owners of the land, the buffalos’ original use of it was really quite frivolous, whereas the ponies wanted it to produce food for themselves. Once trade became a possibility, however, Thunderhooves immediately saw that the land could produce the most profit for his tribe by allowing it to be worked to serve the ponies’ desires.

It is telling that Twilight, despite her usual astuteness, was incapable of understanding the situation or of providing any helpful analysis even after it had been resolved. As one might expect of a state-funded intellectual, she has no appreciation of market-oriented solutions even when they stare her in the face.

Her letter to Celestia sums up the issue with a line from Pinkie Pie’s song “You have to share. You have to care.” She has learned nothing. The ultimate peace between ponies and buffalo involved neither sharing nor caring (beyond recognizing one another as morally autonomous agents and potential trading partners) but rather private property and comparative advantage.

There is a strong connection here with the works of F. A. Hayek and his depiction of market as a “spontaneous order” held together by forces that are not necessarily understood by the participants within it. None of the characters, even Chief Thunderhooves, whose idea resolves the dilemma, correctly states the nature of the resolution in general terms. He simply identifies and takes advantage of a specific scenario. Like the Hayekian entrepreneur who is alert to opportunities, Thunderhooves’s mind is open. Upon tasting the apple pie, his mind is flooded with possibilities. The voluntary society is composed out of innumerable acts such as this, without anyone involved necessarily seeing the entire picture or thinking about any of it from an economist’s perspective. I suspect that the writers were themselves unaware of the Hayekian interpretation that this episode conveys, which, if true, would be a delightful irony.

## *Future Episode Ideas*

The main criticism I could make to this episode is that the conflict is framed in terms of which _society_ has a right to the land and does not give any evidence of _individual ownership_. Are we to assume that the Appleloosans were communal farmers? If so, a good followup to this story might take its inspiration from the original Jamestown colony, whose colonists were beset by starvation until the communal farm was divided into individual lots.

I would like to see the show go much further. Perhaps a future _Friendship is Magic_ could be about seasteading? Or maybe private police and court firms? Maybe an episode on Austrian business cycle theory? Ultimately, there really ought to be an episode clarifying the nature of the Celestian hegemony and questioning the benevolent portrayal of Celestia, whose actions, ---[as certain fans have noted](https://web.archive.org/web/20120501000027/http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/08/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sumbit-to-the-will-of-the-ponies/)---, can be looked at in a very different light. A revisionist history of Equestria is needed, along with all its revolutionary implications!
