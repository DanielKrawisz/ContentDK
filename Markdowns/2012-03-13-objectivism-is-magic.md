This article is about one of my favorite episodes of _Friendship is Magic_, an episode called _Suited for Success_, and which, as I will show, is a brilliant objectivist parable.

## *Story*

The episode begins with Rarity hard at work constructing a gown, which is now in its earliest stages, for her night at the Grand Galloping Gala, whereupon enters Twilight to ask if Rarity might repair a rent in the dress which she plans to wear. Rarity declares Twilight’s drab, childish dress to be inappropriate for the Grand Galloping Gala and insists on making a new one for her. The situation escalates from there as Rarity learns that neither Applejack nor Rainbow Dash are prepared with sumptuous garments.

“IDEEEAAA!!!” she exclaims in a moment of utter brilliance. This is a great example of how wonderful the writing is on this show, that they can put her essence in one word: her extreme personality, her passionate self-direction and overbearing will, and her powerful, gushing emotions; it’s all there!

Rarity then states her intention to make gowns for the entire clique and to give her own fashon show afterwords. “So,” says Applejack, “all you have to do is make a different stunnin’, original, amazin’ outfit for onetwothreefourfive… plus yourself, six ponies in lickity split?”

“Oh Applejack! You make it sound like it’s going to be hard!” Rarity laughs.

A musical montage follows. The song is [---Art of the Dress---](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbXGsysAAk&feature=related) based on [---Putting It Together---](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-836TtoF_5I) by Stephen Sondheim. The gowns Rarity designs during this period are intriguing and clearly very carefully designed by show’s artists. They are not just like a human garment deformed to fit the body of a pony, but look like something a sapient pony really _would_ wear.

They are not so much gowns as capes which drape across their hindquarters, designed to be looked at from the side rather than the front. They are extremely revealing but of course the ponies normally go around nude anyway. They each have an accompanying hat or headdress. I was impressed by the way they provide depth to the world of Equestria and it is unfortunate that artists on the show did not put as much thought into the rest of the garments in the series.

The way that each of the ponies reacts to her gown is the most brilliant part of the episode and provides us with some delightful character moments. None is satisfied, but each for different reasons.

“The arm’s size tight; the midi color doesn’t go with the shoulder lapel; the hands are clearly machine stitch; the pleats are uneven; the fabric looks like twill; you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a taut stitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch; and the overall design is more reminiscent of _pret-a-porter_ and not true French _haut couture_.”

Fluttershy, normally so reserved, so softspoken, shows us here that there is much happening below her surface. She gives us a glimpse of an observant, detail-oriented mind trained to detect an anomaly at a glance. Not only does she develop in a surprising way here, but if course it is perfectly within her ability to care for hundreds of pets at once so it ends up being very consistent with her character.

As to what she said, _pret-a-porter_ refers to a mass-produced garment and _haut couture_ refers to a unique hand-made garment, so Fluttershy is complaining that her gown is not of the quality she would expect from a true craftsman.

Rainbow Dash, on the other hand, wants her gown to be cooler and eventually tells Rarity that “it needs to be about 20% cooler”. This is a perfect response for Rainbow Dash. She thinks she is being clear because her mind is so firmly planted in her body that she fails to clearly grasp the subtleties of language and the vastness of the imagination.

Those were the best responses. Twilight wants the stars on her dress to be more astronomically correct; Pinkie Pie wants more party-themed items attached, and Applejack wants Later there is a reprise of the song, and here things get weird. The lyrics are clearly out of character and incongruous with the actual situation.

_All we ever want is indecision._

All we really like is what we know.

Gotta balance style with adherence,

Making sure we make a good appearance.

Even if you simply have to fudge it

Make sure that it stays within our budget

Got to overcome intimidation

Remember it’s all in the presentation!

This does not make much sense because the ponies would not satirize themselves in their own song and they say things that do not actually apply to the situation: there is not actually a budget, for example.

The most logical explanation here is that the show has gone meta, and the song is not a satire of its characters but rather of something exterior—possibly the show’s executives. If this is true (and I hope it is!) then it’s a really brilliant and psychedelic moment, similar to how Ren and Stimpy used to spoof their own executives a lot.

Finally comes the fashion show. This next part of the episode is too horrible to watch. The ponies walk out, dreadfully attired, on stage for the fashion show, and only there, in front of many watchful ponies, do they apprehend their own tackiness. And Hoity Toity a fashion critic who came all the way from Canterlot, croons about how absurd they all look.

In the end, the other ponies apologize to Rarity by making the gown she had designed for herself—which she had neglected by putting so much work into theirs—precisely according to her specifications, and [---her reaction is priceless---](https://web.archive.org/web/20140308194245/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0IjmWfUizU). Finally, Hoity Toity returns to Ponyville for some reason and they manage to get a do—over with him, whereupon he is impressed with Rarity’s original designs. This part of the show did not seem real to me. One possible interpretation of the ending is that Rarity died of embarrassment earlier in the episode and she is in heaven, or perhaps she went mad and this is her hallucination.

##*Parallels*

There are striking parallels between _Suited for Success_ and Ayn Rand’s _The Fountainhead_. Both Rarity and Howard Roark, the protagonist of _The Fountainhead_ support themselves by their creativity, Rarity as a fashon designer and Roark as an architect.

Howard Roark similarly has a problem with helping other people too much. He can’t stand to see a bad architectural design and not fix it. He keeps getting involved in projects that won’t make him any money or that are likely to cause him trouble—as when he helps his less—talented friend Peter Keating with designs for the Cosmo-Slotnick competition and for the Cortlandt Homes project.

Like Roark, Rarity takes on extra work because her eye is so tuned to artistic composition that she can’t stand to see imperfect work. Yet the consequence for her is the opposite of Roark’s. Whereas Roark allows others to receive credit for his compromised work, Rarity ends up allowing misguided designers to interfere with work for which she receives all the credit.

In the end, they each succeed by asserting to value and protect their own creativity. An artistic work which is not directed under a single will will be inharmonious, inappropriate, tacky, and it is only by protecting the vision of that director from compromise that the final product can be something beautiful.

##*Contrasts*

I don’t know how they do it, but _Friendship is Magic_ astounds me again and again. It consistently features characters who are subtle, complex, funny, and lovable. This as part of what makes the show so compelling; yet at the same time the plots are boldly constructed around such highly abstract and universal themes that everyone can immediately identify with them. In _Suited for Success_, Rarity learns a thing or two about boundaries—something that we all struggle with from infancy through adulthood.

_Suited for Success_ deserves great kudos for taking on the theme of egoism and altruism, a territory that Rand so powerfully dominates. Any work which enters it is likely to evoke emotionally—charged comparisons. Can a story approach this theme without being utterly overshadowed by her influence? _Suited for Success_ has done so and, I would argue, succeeds brilliantly. It approaches its theme confidently, and addresses it elegantly, all the while avoiding the flaws which pervade Rand’s work.

It is obvious, for example, that the characters in _Friendship is Magic_ are infinitely superior to anything ever conceived by Rand. For all her gifts for pithiness, wit, and satire, Rand populated her novels with some of the most starkly one-dimensional characters in all of world literature. Each one merely repeats the same drama over and over. They are extremely compulsive that way, like robots or child abuse victims. They have very little in the way of emotional arcs and there is nothing personable about any of them.

The characters in _Friendship is Magic_ are the exact opposite. It’s hard to think of a show with more well-developed characters. Although they have extreme personalities (and this is the source of much of the humor of the show) they always find new ways to interact and grow, and their extreme traits often come into play in surprising ways.

One of the pleasures following a story is to search for underlying meanings in it. This is impossible in Rand’s books because everything is spoonfed to the reader like a kindergarten fable, whereas _Friendship is Magic_, ostensibly a children’s show, is layered with subtle meaning.
